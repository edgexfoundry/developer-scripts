## Nightly Build 

### Docker Compose for Nightly Build

Available releases include:

    uses the latest EdgeX nightly build container images from the EdgeX Nexus repository. 

* [`releases/nightly-build/compose-files/docker-compose-nexus-no-secty.yml`](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/developer-scripts/tree/master/releases/nightly-build/compose-files/docker-compose-nexus-no-secty.yml) 
    uses the latest EdgeX nightly build container images from the EdgeX Nexus repository and does not include security 
    services.

The Docker Compose files have device service elements that have all been commented out (except for the device-virtual

    but Consul will not be able to appropriately know the status of all the services.
