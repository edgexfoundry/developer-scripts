## Edgex Docker Compose Builder

This folder contains the `Compose Builder` which is made up of **source** compose and environment files and **makefile** for building the single file docker composes files for the configured `release`. The default release is `nexus` and the generated compose files are placed in `release/nightly-build/compose-files`. 

> **Note to Developers**: 
> *Once you have edited and tested your changes to these source files you **MUST** regenerate the composes using the `make build` command.*

### Generate next release compose files

Do the following to build compose files for next release such as `hanoi` 

1. Update the `RELEASE`, `REPOSITORY`, `CORE_EDGEX_REPOSITORY` and `versions` contained in the `.env` file.
2. Create the release folder, i.e `release/hanoi/compose-files`
3. Run `make build` 
4. Commit changes, open PR and merge PR
5. TAG repo for new release, i.e. `1.3.0`
   - This is need for generating dot releases and allows user to get back to the `release` source compose and .env files so they can generate custom compose files base on the `release`.  
6. **Undo changes made to `.env` file**. (values on master branch **must** remain as `nexus/nightly-build`)
7. Commit changes, open PR and merge PR

### Multiple Compose files approach

The approach used with these source compose files is the `Extending using multiple Compose files` described here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files


The `Extending using multiple Compose files` approach along with environment files removes the all of the duplication found in previous EdgeX compose files. This approach makes running the solution more complicated due to having to list the multiple compose files required to run a particular configuration. To alleviate this complexity we are providing the generated single file compose files one level up and a `Makefile` has been provided here with commands that make it easy to run the multiple possible configurations while testing your changes. See the Makefile section below for details on these commands.

> *Note: The `make run`, `make pull` and `make gen` commands all generate a single `docker-compose.yml` file containing the content from the multiple compose files, environment files with all variables resolved for the specified options used. See below for list of options.*

### Compose Files

This folder contains the following compose files:

- **docker-compose-base.yml**
    Base non-secure mode compose file. Contains all the services that run in the non-secure configuration.  
- **add-security.yml**
    Security **extending** compose file. Adds the additional security services and configuration of services so that all the services are running in the secure configuration.
- **add-device-bacnet.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device Bacnet**  service.
- **add-device-camera.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device Camera**  service.
- **add-device-grove.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device Grove**  service.
- **add-device-modbus.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device Modbus**  service.
- **add-device-mqtt.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device MQTT**  service.
- **add-device-random.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device Random**  service.
- **add-device-rest.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device REST** service.
- **add-device-snmp.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device SNMP**  service.
- **add-device-virtual.yml**
    Device Service **extending** compose file, which adds the **Device Virtual**  service.
- **add-mqtt-messagebus.yml**
    MQTT **extending** compose file. Adds a MQTT Broker and additional configuration of services so that the `MQTT` implementation of the Edgex Message Bus is used.
- **docker-compose-ui.yml**
    Stand-alone compose file for running the optional EdgeX UI. Runs in `host` network mode and only supports connecting to local Edgex services via 127.0.0.1 IP address.

### Environment Files

This folder contains the following environment files:

- **.env**
    This file contains the `version`, `repositories` and image `version` variables referenced in compose files. Docker compose implicitly uses the `.env` file, if it exists, so you will not see it referenced in the compose files. It is referenced in the Makefile so that it can also use these settings.
- **common.env**
    This file contains the common environment overrides used by all Edgex services.
- **common-security.env**
    This file contains the common security related environment overrides used by many Edgex services.

### Makefile

This folder contains a `Makefile` that provides commands for running, stopping and cleaning the various EdgeX configurations during **development** of the compose files or testing `dev` versions of the service images.

```
```
portainer       Runs Portainer independent of the EdgeX services
